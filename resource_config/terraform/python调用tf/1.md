## 安装包

你的系统中一样要先安装 terraform,这个不在这里介绍了



下载模块包

![](../imgs/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20200102143156.png)



```
wget https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/60/a2/10fa8a5d79096f96f0a1b9917fe3038b453e40b39cc22e07410a365f2dc3/python-terraform-0.10.1.tar.gz
tar -xf python-terraform-0.10.1.tar.gz
cd python-terraform-0.10.1/
sudo python3 setup.py install
```



安装好后来看一下有那些方法

```

## 来一个例子



```

$ cat main.tf
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "wfwfwo****"
  secret_key = "Bk0UBK1***********f"
  region = "eu-north-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
 ami = "ami-2757f631"   # 这要换上你有的镜像
 instance_type = "t3.micro"
}

$ python3
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) 
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from python_terraform import *
>>> t = Terraform()
>>> t.init()

# 由于它是返回一个元组,第2个元素是回执信息,全部在一起并不方便阅读,所以我们接下来要处理成一行一行看

>>> for pstr in t.plan()[1].split('\n'):
...     print(pstr)

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.

我列出一下terraform命令对应的这python语句

```

terraform init
>>> t.init()    

terraform plan
>>> t.plan()

terraform apply --auto-approve
>>> t.apply(skip_plan = True) 

terraform show
>>> t.show()
```
