## 1.Terraform 安装



- 下载zip包安装



下载zip 文件 https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
解压后直接就能用。把文件放到合适的路径，比如 /usr/local/bin



```shell
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.15/terraform_0.12.15_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.12.15_linux_amd64.zip

./terraform -v   # 通过查看版本确认安装成功
Terraform v0.12.15
sudo ln -s /opt/terraform/terraform /usr/bin/.   # 创建软链接到全局可用
```



- brew安装

```shell
# debian
sudo apt install linuxbrew-wrapper
brew install terraform

# redhat

```



## 2.创建配置文件



像 git 一样，每个 Terraform 项目需要自己单独的目录空间，所以我们创建一个 terraform-learning 目录

    mkdir terraform-learning
    cd terraform-learning

该目录下的所有  *.tf 文件都会被 Terraform 加载，在初始化 Terraform 工作空间之前必须至少要有一个 *.tf 文件。我们这里建立文件 main.tf, 内容如下



```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  profile = "itcp"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "s3_buchet" {
  bucket = "itcp-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags {
    Name  = "Created by Terraform"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

```



Terraform 配置的语法是该公司 HashiCorp 独创的 HCL(HashiCorp configuration language), 它可以兼容 JSON 格式。

上面 tf 文件在 Vim 中的语法加亮是安装的 hashivim/vim-terraform 插件。

我们写好了 *.tf 文件后可以调用 terraform fmt 对配置文件进行格式化，它比较喜欢被 Java 弃用的等号对齐的格式。



实验

```
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region = "us-east-1" 
} 

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
 ami = "ami-2757f631"   ＃ 这要换上你有的镜像
 instance_type = "t2.micro" 
}
```



```shell
# 初始化
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.aws: version = "~> 2.36"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

＃ 下面的是执行过程
boeving@xfce-desktop:~/code/shell/terraform-learning$ terraform apply . 

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.example: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.example: Still creating... [30s elapsed]

＃ 查看状态
boeving@xfce-desktop:~/code/shell/terraform-learning$ terraform state show
Exactly one argument expected.

Usage: terraform state show [options] ADDRESS

  Shows the attributes of a resource in the Terraform state.

  This command shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform
  state. The address argument must be used to specify a single resource.
  You can view the list of available resources with "terraform state list".

Options:

  -state=statefile    Path to a Terraform state file to use to look
                      up Terraform-managed resources. By default it will
                      use the state "terraform.tfstate" if it exists.

## 3.配置文件介绍



从正式跨入 terraform 命令正题之前先来大概的介绍一下上面那个 main.tf 文件。

1) provider "aws" 部分，它指定选用什么 provider, 以及验证信息。aws 既允许指定 access_key 和 secret_key

    provider "aws" {
      region      = "us-east-1"
      access_key  = "your-access-key-here"
      secret_key  = "your-secret-key-here"
    }

也能够指定证书文件中的 profile

    provider "aws" {
      region                   = "us-east-1"
      shared_credentials_file  = "~/.aws/credentials"   //不指定的话，默认值是 "~/.aws/credentials"
      profile                  = "yanbin"                        //不指定的话，默认值是 "default"
    }

如果是使用 shared_credentials_file 中的 profile, 请确定您以预先生成好的 credentials 文件及有效的 profile。
